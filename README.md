> oil_lamp is a repository for the embedded system aboard a DHR gimballed oil lamp that has been modified and augmented into a
recording and proprietary playback device. The Gimballed Oil Lamp Wave Recording and Playback Device (GOLWRPD: *Goldwrapped*: Goldie for short) is a cultural apparatus to gather non-cultural information.

Goldie has two modes: 
* **Recording Mode** (RM)
* **Playback Mode** (PM)

The hardware modifications and electronic requirements to support **RM** will be permanent to the host lamp. 
The hardware modifications and electronic requirements to support **PM** need to be able to connect and disconnect from host lamp and **RM** equiptment with minimal effort and trace.
